# weather_prediction
This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of weather data from different areas of Australia and aims to build a binary classification model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow. The dataset used for this task is a midsized collection of weather records, which provides valuable insights into the weather patterns and allows us to develop a machine learning model for rain prediction.
In this notebook, we will follow a structured workflow to explore the weather dataset, preprocess the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineer relevant features, train a binary classification model, and evaluate its performance. We will utilize popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, model training, and visualization.
The dataset is encoded using Labelencoder and the output of the datset was imbalanced. So as to make it balance i performed Oversampling.
Finaly i  find out the accuracy of dataset using diffrent machinelearning algorithams. The algorithams used are
 1.DecisionTreeClassifier()
 2.RandomForestClassifier()
 3.KNeighborsClassifier()
 4.SVC() (support vector classifier)
